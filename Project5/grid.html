                <div class="par" id="par1"><i class="bi bi-1-square"></i>What is a pension plan?</div>
                <p>A pension plan is fundamentally a simple product:
                    It is just a pot of cash that you, and your employer, can pay into and which you get tax relief on
                    as a way of saving up for your retirement.

                    Then, at retirement, you can draw money from your pension pot or exchange the cash with an insurance
                    company for a regular income until death, called an annuity.

                    Since 2015, from the age of 55, you've been able to access your pension plan more flexibly, taking
                    as much or as little cash as you like, whenever you like. It's worth noting the Government's said
                    this will rise to age 57 in 2028, so could have an impact on your pension planning.

                    But it's important to understand how saving for a pension affects your income. Essentially you're
                    giving up disposable income now in exchange for a future pay rise (in the form of pension income).
                    As you'll be getting less in your pay packet, consider this carefully when budgeting. See our free
                    Budget Planner tool.</p>
                <div class="par" id="par2"><i class="bi bi-2-square"></i>Is a pension really worth it?</div>
                <p>A key benefit of a pension plan is the tax relief, which comes in two forms depending on whether
                    you're a basic-rate or higher-rate taxpayer.

                    You get some tax back on the money you put into a pension, while gains from the investments you make
                    with that cash are largely tax-free.

                    You get the tax back you've paid on all contributions, if you're under 75, subject to an annual
                    allowance.

                    What tax relief do I get?
                    How does the tax relief work?
                    Are you self-employed? Data shows a record five million people are now self-employed, yet saving for
                    a pension among this group is also at a record low. Don't ignore saving into a pension if you're
                    self-employed. Read on for how much you should be saving and how to get a cheap pension. </p>
                <div class="par" id="par3"><i class="bi bi-3-square"></i>How much I should put in a pension?</div>
                <p>With auto-enrolment workplace pensions, there are minimum contribution levels. But if you can afford
                    it, you really should be contributing more.


                    Before starting, it's worth noting those in debt, especially at high rates of interest, should
                    consider whether it'd be better to get rid of that before starting a pension. Plus, a pension's only
                    one form of retirement planning. Combining it with other methods is often a good plan.

                    The basic advice with pensions is to put in is as much as possible, as early as possible. There's a
                    rule of thumb for what to contribute for a comfortable retirement...

                    Take the age you start your pension and halve it. Then put this % of your pre-tax salary into your
                    pension each year until you retire.
                    So someone starting aged 32 should contribute 16% of their salary for the rest of their working
                    life. While 16% of your pay may seem a huge commitment, this figure includes your employer's
                    contribution â€“ so you only need to fund the rest.

                    Some additional points follow from this rule of thumb:

                    Don't delay
                    Increase payments
                    Use the 'pay rise trick'
                    For a more accurate way of calculating how much you need to retire, try using the Money Advice
                    Service's pension calculator. It'll ask for information including when you want to retire, how much
                    you and your employer are contributing, and whether you want your pension to be inflation-proof.</p>
                <div class="par" id="par4"><i class="bi bi-4-square"></i>The different types of pensions</div>
                <p>Pensions come in all shapes and sizes. The first distinction is whether the pension is a final salary
                    or a money purchase pension.


                    Final salary

                    These pensions, also called defined benefit schemes, or in some cases Career Average Revalued
                    Earnings (CARE) schemes, are largely funded by employers, though staff may also have to pay into
                    them. With these, you get a percentage of your final pre-retirement salary, or when leaving that
                    firm, as an annual income.

                    More on final salary pensions...
                    Money purchase pensions

                    With money purchase pensions, also known as defined contribution schemes, the money you put into
                    your pension plan is invested and what you have at retirement depends on how those investments have
                    performed.
                    More on money purchase pensions...
                    Pension plans can also be categorised as:

                    Workplace pension schemes
                    Trust-based pensions
                    Group personal pensions
                    Stakeholder pensions
                    Self-invested personal pensions (SIPPs)
                    Quick question

                    What about the state pension?</p>
                <div class="par" id="par5"><i class="bi bi-5-square"></i>How do I get a pension?</div>
                <p>Under the new rules, many people will end up in a company pension through auto-enrolment, so all they
                    need to do is go ahead with what their employer offers. To get any contributions your employer
                    offers, you'll normally need to be part of its scheme.

                    If you choose your own pension then you'll need to scour the market for the most suitable plan.

                    Unless you're financially savvy, it's usually best to get advice from an independent financial
                    adviser (IFA), given the whole host of pension charges to watch out for. Since January 2013, IFAs
                    can no longer be paid in commission, so you'll have to pay a fee for advice.

                    See our Financial advisers guide for how to pick an IFA, including what getting advice will cost
                    you.</p>
                <div class="par" id="par6"><i class="bi bi-6-square"></i>How safe is my pension?</div>
                <p>With savings accounts, the simple rule is that up to Â£85,000 per person per institution is fully
                    protected should your bank go bust. This protection's provided by the UK's Financial Services
                    Compensation Scheme (FSCS, see the Savings safety guide).


                    This Â£85,000 limit has been extended to pensions and investments from 1 April 2019. Previously the
                    FSCS limit was just Â£50,000, except for annuities â€“ where cover was and remains unlimited.

                    FSCS protection for pensions can seem very complex. This is just a general guide, always check with
                    your provider.

                    The FSCS does not generally cover performance losses, for example, if the shares you invest in were
                    to go bust, though it can cover poor investment management.

                    The FSCS safety does apply if you lose money due to the pension or investment firm going bust.
                    Usually with pensions, if you buy through a broker it doesn't hold any of the cash, it simply acts
                    as a conduit for you to put the money into whatever funds or investments you want. Therefore in the
                    unlikely event the broker goes bust, your money should be OK, and still held by the fund manager or
                    bank it resides with. The Â£85,000 protection applies should any of those go bust.

                    If protection kicks in, the FSCS will first try to transfer your funds from the failed company to
                    another company.

                    For failed IFAs or brokers that mis-sold or provided dodgy pension advice, there may be a claim
                    against the firm for mis-selling via the FSCS. This would be up to the investment limit of Â£85,000.

                    If you've got a defined benefit (final salary) pension, there's a risk of your employer going bust,
                    leaving you with no pension income. In this case, the Pension Protection Fund (PPF) is available and
                    may pay compensation.</p>
